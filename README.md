```lrc
[00:12.32] Never trust a bitch who finds love in a camera
[00:14.92] She will fuck you, then turn around and fuck a janitor
[00:17.83] Set the parameters
[00:19.31] You either with the pro ballers or the amateurs
[00:22.57] I won't let you ruin my dreams or Harvey Weinstein the kid
[00:27.02] Good morning, Matt Lauer, can I live?
[00:29.33] Look at my new digs
[00:30.83] The rooftop can host a paint and sip for like 40
[00:33.68] The Warhols on my wall paint a war story
[00:36.75] Had to find other ways to invest
[00:39.40] Cause you rappers found every way to ruin Pateks
[00:42.34] It's a nightmare, yeah
[00:44.39] I'm too rare amongst all of this pink hair, ooh
[00:47.17] Still do the Fred Astaire on a brick
[00:50.28] Tap tap, throw the phone if you hear it click
[00:53.18] Art Basel in the bezel
[00:54.80] Your bustdown is bust down and don't match the metal
[00:57.43] Lower level's where you settle at
[00:59.57] I'm the pot callin' the kettle black
[01:01.66] Where there's no brick peddles at
[01:03.76] Between God and where the Devil's at
[01:06.11] Had to double dutch and double back
[01:08.04] Then hopscotch through where the trouble's at
[01:10.32] Exactly what the game's been missin'
[01:13.07] This fire burns hot as Hell's Kitchen
[01:15.41] Push
[01:17.41] 
[01:17.85] Now that's how the team go
[01:20.08] I'm back from Santo Domingo
[01:23.33] That's where the kings go
[01:25.89] Down in Santo Domingo
[01:29.55] Now that's how the team go
[01:31.56] Back from Santo Domingo
[01:33.11] This for the sneaker hoarders and coke snorters
[01:35.18] Cause that's where the kings go
[01:37.07] Down in Santo Domingo
[01:38.39] From Honda Accords to Grammy awards
[01:39.41] That's where the kings go
[01:51.91] 
[01:40.40] I can blow a million dollars into dust
[01:42.62] Lord knows how many bottles I've done bust
[01:45.39] Still runnin' through the models like I'm Puff
[01:48.36] Confront my problems like I'm Ralo in the bluff
[01:51.42] Pusha know these politics is paradox
[01:54.23] Chillin' in a condo full of ready rock
[01:57.05] My homie amputated but gon' stand for somethin'
[02:00.10] I'm dyin' to find a way to get a Grammy from it
[02:02.51] (Maybach Music)
[02:03.44] Watchin' my success for some is bittersweet
[02:05.70] Always keep the sharpshooter's triggers tweaked
[02:08.64] Diamonds drippin' on me, V in Tiffany's
[02:11.52] All these K-9 units still sniffin' me
[02:14.77] Ignorance versus the innocence
[02:17.42] It's not the temperature for you in Timberlands
[02:20.23] I keep the coldest flows on the hot seat
[02:23.32] And you can spot my hoes by their car keys
[02:26.33] Another episode full of atrocities
[02:29.01] It's double M, baby, money monopolies
[02:31.64] (Maybach Music)
[02:32.38] You scared to see my face in a fancy place
[02:34.80] So I debate my case vs. a Nancy Grace
[02:37.88] It's flesh and blood 'til I'm fresh as fuck
[02:40.79] Still hands on, sucker, press your luck
[02:43.75] Your money gone every other month
[02:46.74] My money long so the treasure's tucked
[03:05.74] 
[02:50.49] Now that's how the team go,
[02:53.04] I'm back in Santo Domingo
[02:56.51] That's where the kings go,
[02:58.89] Down in Santo Domingo
[03:02.45] Now that's how the team go
[03:04.52] Back in Santo Domingo
[03:08.52] Cause that's where the kings go,
[03:10.54] Down in Santo Domingo
[03:13.28] That's where the kings go
